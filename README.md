# Sistema de Intervenção Estudantil

Assignment for EIACD, 2024-2025

## Summary
### Goal of the project

The aim of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model capable of predicting whether students will pass their final exam, allowing for early identification of students who need additional support.

To accomplish this, the project begins with data preprocessing, followed by the application of multiple Supervised Learning models.
The project encompasses several stages, which involve data exploration, data preprocessing, division into training and testing sets, the selection and training of Machine Learning models, and evaluating model performance through various metrics.

### Tools and algorithms used
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Decision Tree Classifier, K-NN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Balancing Techniques: Down-sampling, SMOTE, ADASYN
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC curves
